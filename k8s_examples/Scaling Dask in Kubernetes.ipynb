    "\n",
    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python. It is purpose-built to parallelize python data science applications from a single laptop all the way up  to a complex 100+ node cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of a Dask scheduler and a scaling number of Dask workers and the APIs are designed to be familiar for anyone who has used Pandas or Numpy in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself Dask accelerates many machine learning applications, but when paired with the additional acclerations of GPUs integrated through the RAPIDS modules it becomes a very powerful tool that no data scientist should be without. \n",

    "Kubernetes (or K8S) is an open source tool for managing container workloads and services. K8S is designed to scale, and can run on single node systems all the way up to entire clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "K8S allows you to deploy docker containers to run tasks. These docker containers are deployed in pods, which can have resources limitations defined, execution commands set, and allows you to specify custom docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "K8S allows dynamic resources addition/removal and can be run on-prem, in the cloud, or using hybrid models.\n",
